# MotionControl
Classes to control lab actuators and other similar devices using MATLAB

## What is this?
These classes are used to drive motion controllers with attached linear actuators.
We use these classes in-house in a variety of projects such as moving microscope stages, sub-stages, objectives, mirrors, etc.
